										Morning Eggo is a pesonal project that I created for my students at Japanese junior highchools. My goal was to create an English newsletter geared towards student interests, and to contain articles/ activities relevant to their lives, as well as practical English tips.  Since it's inception, I have introduced it to three schools.

								<h7>The challenge was to design visuals that were eye-catching and audience-engaging, while following AAFC's branding guidlines; clean, simple and quite conservative. I was provided with copy written material that had been prepared in advance by the department, and was tasked with incorporating the text into my designs in a visually pleasing way.

							<b>Challenge</b><br />
							<h7>Creating an English newsletter had always been a goal of mine. Before arriving in Japan, I had already been exploring extracurricular things that I planned to pursue.</h7>
							<br /><br />
							<h7>The goal was to create a newsletter relevant to students lives. Many students show disinterest when the content is not realistic or relevant. Therefore, I wanted to make a newsletter that would increase student interest in English. Essentially, I wanted to increase student motivation and engagement with the language.</h7>

								<h7>
									I began this project by initially researching other Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) English newsletters. Most of the ones available on the internet were outdated, but still provided a plethora of ideas. I started thinking about what kind of topics I would cover.
									‍<br /><br />
									I wanted to include my own interests so that students could get to know me. The newsletter would help students approach me, since many are shy and would otherwise not talk to me. I decided on sections such English tips, shop recommendations, comics, my favorite songs and adventures such as hiking, visiting other prefectures, arts and craft workshops, tea ceremony and more.
									<br /><br />
									Another thing that I noticed, was that many of the example ALT newsletters were entirely in English. I know that can be extremely intimidating and demotivating, so I wanted to sprinkle bits of Japanese in the article. This way students could feel within their comfort zone. They also would not be able to say "I don't understand English!"
Because alas, there is also Japanese!<br /><br />
Next, I began brainstorming a name for the newsletter. I knew that I wanted something witty and clever. It didn't take too long before the idea "Morning Eggo" came to me. In Canada, I grew up eating eggos; a waffle-type breakfast food. Conveniently, "Eggo" sounds like "Eigo", which is the Japanese word for English! (I was pretty proud of myself for coming up with this.)

								<h7>
									Morning Eggo has been highly successful in increasing student participation and motivation towards English. With each issue, I have roughly twenty students per each grade complete the activities and questions. Several students approach me throughout school hours to talk about Morning Eggo's topics. Whenenver I announce that a new issue is out, I have observed students gather around the English bulletin board where they can take copies of the newsletter, excitedly chatting to each other about it. Not only students, but other teachers have also shown interest in it.
									‍<br /><br />
									Every season I make three versions tailored towards each grade. In addition, each issue roughly follows the same format. Usually the front page consists of a "Crystal's Adventures" article, my top five songs of the month, and an English tip. I usually ask the Japanese English teachers which grammar points students are struggling with, or based on my own observation in class and knowledge of the curriculum, will cover a grammar point relevant to their current studies. The back side typically contains a movie/book/cafe recommendation, and a comic or section for them to draw their own comic using a specific grammar point. However due to the corona, I replaced "Crystal's Adventures" with artist/movie/book recommendations.
									<br /><br />

									One unique challenge that I discovered was working with the Japanese for print design. Prior to Morning Eggo, I had not used Japanese for any graphic design projects. As a result, I was unfamilar with the Japanese font database. Initially I made the mistake of using North American fonts for Japanese text, but eventually discovered that the characters were actually incorrect. Morning Eggo is a side project that I thoroughly enjoy and I hope to work more with Japanese print in the future!
