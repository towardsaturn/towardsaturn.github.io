										This case study is based off of a project that I was tasked with while working at 411 Seniors Centre in 2016. <br />
										I had been asked to redesign the logo, and acquire feedback surrounding the client‚Äôs existing website.
										Leading this project, I was responsible for user research, visual design, and developing wireframes and prototypes.

								<h7>
									My challenge was to redesign a logo, and determine user's likes and dislikes about the current website.
<br/><br/>
									
									
									In order to do so, I set out to:<br />
									1. Gather data on the thoughts and opinions of the users regarding the orignal logo (see below)<br />
									2. Listen to what the centre users wanted in the new logo<br />
									3. User thoughts on the existing website<br />
									4. Based on the above, redesign a logo and create wireframes <br />
									<br/><br/>

									<i>The original logo design.</i></center>
								
								</h7><br /><br />

							<h7><b>Process</b></h7><br /><br />
							<h7>The first step was to gather quantitative and qualitative data regarding the current logo and website. I created an anonymous online survey and sent it out to the mailing list comprised of 231 users. To avoid selection-bias, in person interviews were also conducted with users who did not have access to e-mail or the internet. In total, 42 participants responded. 
						</h7><br /><br />
							
							
							<b><h7>Example Questions:</b></br><br /></h7>
							<h7>1. Do you believe that 411's current branding reflects its objectives well? <br />
2. What are your thoughts on our current logo? <br />
3. What elements would you like to see in our new logo? Provide key words. E.g.: Dynamic, Reliable, Business-like etc.<br />

							</h7>
							<br /><br />
							<b><h7>Survey Results:</b></h7>
							<br /><br />
							<center><img src="411/graph.png" width =80%></center><br/>
							<h7>Interestingly, those who answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù were of the same value. 
								Respondents used keywords such as "more colors, welcoming, and human connections" when asked what they would like to see in the new logo.<br />

								Data was regarding the website was also surveyed. The results showcased that users wanted smaller, less intimidating images, larger font, more colors, and content about activism.<br/>

								<h7>
									After analyzing the data, it was clear that members wished for a logo that was colorful, warm, welcoming, and embodied human connections. 
									With these points in mind, I sketched some logos.
									‚Äç<br /> 
									<center><img src="411/low hi sketch.png" width=60%></center><br />

									I decided to go with the one on the left, and changed the colors to brighter shades. This is what resulted:<br />
									<center><img src="411/logo.png" width=40%></center> <br />
								

									As for the website, I sketched the following Low-fi wireframes. (Could probably work on my penmanship..) <br /><br />
									<center><img src="411/LoFiWireframes.png" width=90%></center><br />
									
									And proceeded to transfer my thought process over to figma, creating digital wireframes.<br /><br />
									<center><a href="411/411 Wire FrameLarger.png" > <img src="411/411WireFramesResized.png" width=90%></center></a><br />

									The final next step, was where I could start to bring my design to life, and to create some prototypes! <br /> <br />
									<center><a href="411/411PrototypeDisplayLarger.png"><img src="411/411PrototypeDisplayresized.png" width=91%></a></center><br />

									While mindful of the intended audience (the older folks!), as well as the survey responses, I aimed to create a simple, clean layout. 
									Key points include less intimidating photos (previously of extremely close up face shots), no extremely light fonts, etc. 
									<br/><br />
									I also changed the ‚ÄúJoin us!‚Äù page in the navigation, to ‚ÄúMembership‚Äù as per one users‚Äô request. And on the actual membership page,
									<br />I resized and organized the boxes for the sign-up form to make better use of white space. Furthermore, under the ‚ÄúWhat services are you interested in‚Äù, I directly listed examples of offered services (such as yoga classes, information and referral services, etc.), allowing potential members to select as many boxes as they‚Äôd like. Listing all the services offered could also pull further interest and introduce potential members to programs that they may not have previously been aware of.
									<br /><br />

									Compiling all my user-research and results into a powerpoint presentation, I pitched my findings and suggestions to the Executive Director. I was met with extremely positive feedback, and the executive director kept my data on hand so that they could utilize it in the near future. 
									<br /><br />

									Limitations that I encountered were that although the centre supposedly has 432 members, only 42 surveys were collected. In-person interviews (3) were limited, and could have been influenced by interviewer bias. There was also the possibility that members perceived, ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù as interchangeable with ‚ÄúGood‚Äù when rating the website. In-person participants had the ability to ask for further clarification whereas those who did the online survey did not.  If I did this project again, I would have created more specific options for the survey.
