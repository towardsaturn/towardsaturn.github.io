										For this project, the client requested an application that would simplify the shopping experience at Fujisaki, a large department store in Sendai. The concept was for customers to electronically select products via the app, which would print out a receipt. Customers could then bring the receipt to the cashier register, where they would pay for and pick up the item.

								<h7>
									Working in a team with the software engineer and project leaders, my job was to design wireframes and high fidelity prototypes. Important points I focused on were usability and a stylish design that catered to a target audience composed of all ages, but a large majority being older adults.

							<h7><b>Research</b></h7><br /><br />
							<h7>
							As a Sendai resident for approximately three and a half years, I have been to Fujisaki a handful of times. So, I began my creative research process 
							by jotting down notes and impressions that I had of Fujisaki.
						
						</h7><br /><br /><br />
							<center><img src="Fuji/notes.jpeg" width=50%></center>
							
							<h7>
								I also looked for stock images of things that I knew Fujisaki sold such as kokeshi dolls, akabeko, skincare/bath sets, etc. I wanted to have a clean, simple look that had large images and text. It was important for the buttons to have text, and not solely icons to ensure that it was user-friendly to seniors as well. During this stage, I also viewed other Japanese websites to gain familiarity with Japanese UX/UI. I looked at apps such as Uniqlo, GU, Fujisaki‚Äôs homepage and Mercari, paying attention to their layout, fonts, and language.

							<br /> 
							<h7>
								Then, I created a persona to help me draft. Since I knew that the majority of the users would be older, I asked friends‚Äô parents and older friends who shop at Fujisaki. I asked them what features they like/dislike on apps, as well as what they look for in a product when shopping for a gift. Some highlights included, them not knowing the hamburger menu, being less intuitive when it comes to buttons that are only icons without text, and a dislike for red text or small items.

									‚Äç<br /> 
							<h7>With this research under my belt, I sketched up some low-fi wireframes. I tacked on the idea of a customer survey at the end as well.

								And with Figma, I quickly whipped up some wireframes injecting bits of color and images to give me an idea and inspiration for direction.<br/>

									<i>At this stage, the survey was an idea, and had not been approved yet so I didn't full actualize the layout yet.</i>
	

								</center><br/><br/>
								<h7>Then, I designed some high-fidelity prototypes. The software engineer requested that I communicate the design for interactive elements such as hovers. So I decided to use Figma‚Äôs animation features and build an interactive prototype. 
									<br /> <br /> <br/>

									<br /> <br/>
									After completion, the project manager and software engineer gave me feedback on my design. They suggested that I decrease the size of items and change the font, and to cut out the Recommendations („Ç™„Çπ„Çπ„É°) option. Based on their advice, I quickly whipped up the final product below:</h7><br />

								<h7>
									Due to the timeline of this project, I was unable to carry out testing. I believe that it‚Äôs especially important to collect data on the characteristics of the app‚Äôs users so that we can use this data for future improvement. Because of this, I added an optional survey at the end, which the client was very on board with. <br /><br />
									However, I would have tested the following items on a scale of 1-5 for usability: <br /><br />
									1. Narrowing down products by price (ÈáëÈ°ç„Åã„ÇâÈÅ∏„Å∂) or Sendai Gift Sets (‰ªôÂè∞Â∞èÁÆ±).<br />

									2. Locating the product desired<br />
3. Successfully adding the product or quantity of the product desired<br />
4. Understanding how to return to the home page.<br />
5. Locating the cart button and view items in their cart<br />
6. Overall time the process takes

								<h7>
									This project was my first time working with Japanese text, as well as designing an Ipad application. So, I was initially unfamiliar with Japanese fonts, as well as Ipad proportions. Through this project I gained lots of valuable insight and experience in the Japanese UX/UI scene. <br /><br />
