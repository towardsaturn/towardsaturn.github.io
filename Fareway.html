									The design brief explained that this was a website/app for travellers between the age of 20-30, with the function to research travel destinations. 
									Therefore, my challenge was to design a website and app that was both stylish, fuctional and up to date with the current trends within the target users.

							<h7><b>Research</b></h7><br /><br />
							<h7>
								I began this project by first looking at travel images to gain design inspiration.

							<h7>
								Next, I interviewed 5 females and 5 males between the ages of 23 and 32. The questions that I asked were:<br /><br />

				1. How often do you travel? (pre-corona) <br />
				2. How savvy are you with tech (on a scale of 1-5)<br />
				3. Do you research prior to traveling? <br />
				4. How important is access to travel information? (on a scale of 1-5)<br />
				5. Do you use the bookmark/save function on apps?<br />
				6. What do you usually do when you travel?<br />
				7. Any additional comments regarding their likes/dislikes of travel planning process<br/><br/>

				 Interesting things to note were that all of the respondents voiced that access to travel information was either a 4 or 5 (out of 5) in terms of importance.
				Also, 33.3% said they use bookmark features often, 33.3% said sometimes, and 33.3% said never. Interestingly, the respondents who chose “sometimes”, also voiced that they only use it if it is well built in, doesn’t require signing up, or that while they use it sometimes, they prefer to take screenshots on their phone or write it down on paper.
				And all respondents expressed that they do short day trips or travel domestically more often than overseas travel. <br/><br/>

				Based on these findings, I formed the persona below. <br /><br /><br />

							<h7><b>Process</b></h7><br /><br />		
							<h7>
							It was important for the design to share consistency across both platforms, which is why I drafted low-fi wireframes for both the desktop and mobile app simultaneously.

									<img src="Fareway/sketch2.png" width=60%>
							
								</center>  <br /> <br/>


								With the layout sketched out, I quickly mocked up some wireframes in Figma. Based on my research, 66.6% of the survey respondents conveyed that they either often or sometimes use the bookmark feature in apps, so I added this design function. Users can also sort search results based on “all”, “recommended” and “popular”. The idea is that users can rate different destinations, and that calculated rating would appear. The Toggle button also allows for users to narrow down potential destinations. They can search using by toggling features such as climate, areas of the world, or activities such as hiking, etc.

									Then, I started to insert colors and design into the prototypes. The color scheme I chose for this project were orange, grey and turquoise elements.

								Upon showing the prototypes to the interviewees, I asked them to provide commentary on
								usability (design, ability to navigate to certain pages such as the account page, etc.) as well as suggestions and concerns.
								The users found the designs easy to navigate and mentioned that they would only be concerned on usage and interface if they were of an older age. Other points that they liked were the simplicity 
								of the webpage and application.

								<h7>
									This was a fun project geared towards young adult users in the same age range as myself, so I found myself inserting my perspective while designing this. This could have worked to my advantage, but it could also be a form of bias. 
									Some other areas of future potential upgrading could be towards increasing community features, such a forum/open board discussion section. Also, many of the interviewees expressed how they
									enjoy eating out while travelling, so another possible update could include "resturants/eats" on the destination information page. <br />
