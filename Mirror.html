							<h9><b>Research Goals</b></h9><br />
								<h7>
									The research goal was to learn <span class="underline">the motivations, likes and dislikes, and pain points</span> of users who shop online, in order to create a responsive where users can successfully find items and check out. 
<br/><br/>

Some of the questions I had were: <br />
<ul>
<li>What drives users to shop online versus offline?</li>  
<li>What helps them decide which online shop to purchase from? (out of all the competitors)</li>
<li>What features help them decide what to buy. </li>
<li>What excites them about online shopping? </li>
<li>What are some challenges they face with online shopping? </li></h7>

</ul>


<h9><b>Market Research</b></h9><br />

First, I conducted some background research on the e-commerce market in Japan to familiarze myself with numbers and trends. I also looked at direct/indirect competitors and gathered data on features they incorporated. I then compiled this research into a competitive analysis so that I could easily compare strengths and weaknesses across the competitors. 
<br/>This process helped me visualize which features I would potentially include in my design. 
<br/><br/>

<div style="text-align:center">

	<img src="mirror/Market research.png" width=80%><br/><br/>
	<img src="mirror/Research Ramp-Up.png" width=80%><br/>
</div><br/></br/>

<h9><b>User Interviews</b></h9><br />

Next, I completed user interviews with <span class="underline">five participants</span> who fit the user demographics (shops online a minimum of bi-monthly). <span class="underline">Three were female</span> and <span class="underline">two were male</span>. They were all between the ages of <span class="underline">24 to 29</span>. Three Japan, and two were in Canada through remote interviews. For each of the interviews, I conducted a usability test with one of the competitors (H&M, Uniqlo, SHEIN, etc) with the participants to pan deeper into their likes and dislikes around online shopping. 
<br/><br/></h7>

</div><br /><br />

<div class="blockhead3"><p>2. Define</p></div><br/><br/>


<div class="body">
	
	<h9><b>Empathy Map</b></h9><br />
		
		
		<h7>After hearing what participants had to say, I transcribed their comments and compiled them into an empathy map, organized into thinking/feeling, seeing, hearing, pains, gains and what they do.
<br/><br/><br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="mirror/Empathy Map.jpeg" width=80%><br/> 
	   </div>

I was able to identify <span class="underline">four key patterns</span> after consolidating the interviews<br/><br/>
<ol>
	<li>People are drawn to the idea of <span class="underline">good deals</span> and <span class="underline">novelty</span> products. In other words, they need information on how they can best spend their money (coupons via newsletters, etc), and access to a variety of items that are in demand or rare in-store. There should also be a <span class="underline">search bar, filters, and plenty of customer reviews</span>, granting users control in their search.</li> </br/>
	<li>People like <span class="underline">convenience</span>; the idea of a quick, low-effort activity. The experience should contain information architecture that users can easily make sense of, transactions that can be conducted in a low total number of clicks, a variety of payment options, and the option of a guest checkout.</li> </br/>


	<li>People enjoy the <span class="underline">human aspect</span> of online shopping. Attentive customer care such as neat packaging, personalized notes/gifts, were all joys expressed by interviewees. They claimed that it conveyed that the business “cared and respected their customers”. The idea of supporting small businesses run by individual people was also a delight expressed by interviewees, as well as <span class="underline">customer reviews</span> written by ordinary people.</li> </br/>

		<li>Expectations not matching Reality: A major pain for online shoppers are <span class="underline">inconsistent images</span> which waste their time, efforts, and prevent them from shopping somewhere. If the product is cheap, they may be disillusioned into accepting their loss and engaging in feelings of disappointment.</li> 
</ol>

<h9><b>User Persona</b></h9><br />
Based on the research and findings discovered, I then created a persona to represent MIRROR's target audience and help guide my design. <br/><br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="mirror/joline.png" width=80%><br/><br/>
		   </div><br/><br/>

		   <h9><b>Project Goals, Features Map and Site Map</b></h9><br />
		   Next, I started to work on the information architecture (IA). I brainstormed project goals, and compiled a road features map to further help me define necessary content. I also made a site map with the goal was to understand how pages were related to each other, and to organize content in a way that would make sense to users. 
		   <br /><br />
		   <div style="text-align:center">
			<a href="mirror/Goals.png" target=_"blank"><img src="mirror/Goals.png" width=90%></a> <br/>

			<a href="mirror/Site Map.jpg" target=_"blank"><img src="mirror/Site Map.jpg" width=80%></a> 
		</div>

		 <h9><b>Card Sort</b></h9><br />		   
		 In order to tap into how users organize items, I conducted an open card sort Optimal Workshop. Users sorted twenty cards in an unsupervised, remote setting. They were told to organize and label items for an online clothing shop.
		 
		 I chose an open card sort to <span class="underline">gain insight on how users cognitively sort clothing items</span>, without any pre-determined, biased categories. This would help me create an IA that makes sense to users, leading to a smoother user experience.<br/></br>


<span class="underline">Seven users participated</span>, ranging from 25 to 29 years old. Three were female, and four were male. Four were based in Japan and three in Canada.

<br/><br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="mirror/Cardsort1.png" width=60%><br/>
	<img src="mirror/Cardsort2.png" width=80%>
	<br/><br/>
		   </div>

		   <h9><b>Card Sort Results</b></h9> 
		   <ul>
			   <li>Participants took an average of <span class="underline">six minutes and 9 seconds</span> to complete the task</li>
			   <li>Five participants created an <span class="underline">“Accessories”</span> category</li>
			   <li>Four created <span class="underline">“Outerwear”</span> category</li>
			   <li>Three created <span class="underline">“Business”</span> or “Formal” categories, with one user stating that they like being able to choose a “Business” option.</li>
			   <li>Only two participants organized the items solely by type. The other five used only styles, or a <span class="underline">mixture of styles and type</span> to sort the items. </li>
			   
			</ul>
	
		</div><br/>

<div class="blockhead3"><p>3. Ideate</p></div><br/><br/>

<div class="body">
	<h9><b>Task and User Flows</b></h9><br />
<h7>To understand how users may interact with the website, I thought about what tasks Joline, my persona, would do based on her goals, as well as the pages that she would encounter in that flow. 
<br/><br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
	<a href="mirror/task flow.png" target=-"blank"><img src="mirror/task flow.png" width=80%></a><br/><br/>
		   </div>

		   Fleshing it out even further, I thought about what decision points would occur within Joline while carrying out the task. These flows are essential to understanding how users may interact with a website, leading to a more optimal user experience. 
		  <br/><br/> <div style="text-align:center">

				   <h9><b>Low-fi Wireframes </b></h9><br />

				   With my research under my belt, I was ready to start Wireframing! I sketched some low-fi wireframes that reflected my research findings, and referred to competitors for design patterns as well. After listening to feedback from my mentor and peers, I then drafted responsive wireframes in Figma for web, mobile and tablet platforms. 
<br/><br/>

<div style="text-align:center">

	<img src="mirror/responsive wireframes.png" width=47%><br/><br/>
		   </div><br/>
		   <h9><b>Branding - Concept</b></h9><br />
		   Before I could move onto prototyping, I needed to develop the brand identity and concept to guide my User interaction Design (UI) choices.

		   I gathered images and color palettes that were <span class="underline">#Clean #Fresh #Simple and #Modern</span> and compiled the mood board below<br/><br/>

		   <div style="text-align:center">
			<img src="mirror/Mood Board.png" width=70%><br/><br/>
				   </div> <br/>
		   
				   <h9><b>Branding - Logo</b></h9><br />
				   Keeping in mind my mood board, I began to brainstorm Logos. I sketched up several, and ultimately chose one based on feedback from my mentor and peers.
<br/><br/>
				   <div style="text-align:center">
					<img src="mirror/Logos.png" width=30%>

						   </div>

						   <h9><b>Branding - UI Kit</b></h9><br />
						   In order to maintain consistency, I created an UI kit. This proved to be very useful as I found myself referring to it as I moved towards the prototyping stage in my process. 
						   Thinking about the developers, I made sure that the different element states for buttons and form fields were accounted for. Moving forward with the UI, I also kept in mind the following <span class="underline">design principles:</span><br/><br/>

						   1. <span class="underline">Consistency:</span> Promote learnability within users, and reduce confusion. <br/>
						   2. <span class="underline">Engaging:</span> Allow users to engage with the product. Sections such as reviews and social media sections allow for user engagment.<br/>
						   3. <span class="underline">Focus:</span> By eliminating distractions, the user can focus on successfully complete their task.<br/>
						   4.<span class="underline">Minimalistic:</span> Remove unecessary elements and break tasks into smaller steps.  <br/>

							<h9><b>Responsive Prototype</b></h9><br />
						
						<h7>Putting everything together, a responsive prototype was built in Figma. <br /><br />

					<br/><br/>	</div> <br />


					<h9><b>Usability Test</b></h9><br />

					<h7>Now, it was time to test the prototype and discover what worked, and what didn’t. <br/></br>

					<span class="underline">Objectives:</span>   <br/>
<ol>			
<li>Observe how easily and efficiently users are able to perform certain tasks (such as completing checkout or locating products) and understand their thought processes while doing so. </li>
<li>Identify what kind, where, when, why and how user frustrations occur. </li>
<li>Observe how many errors occur and assess whether they are recoverable.</li>
<li>Learn user’s overall impressions on the design and branding.</li>
</ol>

<span class="underline">Methodology </span> <br/>
In-person interviews and remote interviews via Zoom screen share.<br/><br/>

<span class="underline">Participants </span> </b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>5 participants in their 20’s</li>
	<li>Three female, two male</li>
	<li>Has substantial experience with online shopping (shops online at least bi-monthly)</li>
</ul>

<span class="underline">Tasks </span> </b><br/>
Users were asked to complete the following:<br/>

<ol>			
	<li>It’s getting cold and you’re in need of a new winter jacket. Your friend has recommended MIRROR to you. Please find yourself a jacket that you like. Feel free to use filters, user reviews, size charts, etc. Add the jacket to your cart and checkout as a guest.</li>

	<li>Your friend Joline has asked for your help in finding a specific item. She is looking for a formal blouse in Size S that is blue, and called “Lantern Sleeve Blouse”.</li>
</ol>

<i><u>NOTE: For men, the first task was changed to “find a jacket for a female friend”. <br/><br/>
</i></u></h7>


<h9><b>Affinity Map</b></h9><br />
<h7>After transcribing my interviews, I created an Affinity Map to help organize my findings and identify key takeaways. 
</h7><br/><br/>



<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="mirror/AffinityMap.jpg" width=70%><br/><br/>
		   </div> 

		   <h9><b>Key Findings</b></h9><br />

		 <h7>
			 
<ol>
	<li>Completion rate was 100%</li>
	<li>Participants overall didn't use the shop by style category to initially find items, and prefer it as a filter but still enjoy having the option.</li>
	<li>Two users expressed wanting to have <span class="underline">additional criteria filters</span> such as filter by style, or sale.</li>
	<li>The checkout process needs <span class="underline">more transparency</span>, such as an order review summary page.</li>
	<li>Users did not care for, nor notice the top of page and live chat buttons.</li>
	<li>Users really liked the variety of payment methods.</li>
	<li>The size chart was difficult to find and content/metrics were unclear.</li>
	<li> Overall the <span class="underline">process</span> was familiar, and participants commented on the site appearing clean, and easy to navigate.</li>

</ol>
</h7>

<h9><b>Priority Chart </b></h9><br />

<h7>
To help guide my next steps, I created a priority revisions chart, organizing tasks into high-level, medium-level and low-level. This proved to be a very useful reference as I dove into iterations. <br/><br/>

<div style="text-align:center" vertical-align:top>

<div class="body">
		<h9><b>What I learned</b></h9><br />
<h7>
		<ul>
			<li>E-commerce Trends: Through the research and implementation of this project, I familiarized myself with design patterns which I previously lacked knowledge on.</li>
			<li>Time prioritization strategies: The time constraints on the projects, and prioritization methods such as creating a road features map, and priority revisions helped me stay on track and focus on MVPs, instead of getting hung up on low priority features.</li>
			<li>This was a project that allowed me to push my research skills further. I was able to conduct a usability test which proved to be extremely insightful at uncovering users' delights and pain points. </li>
		</ul></h7>

		
								<h9><b>What I would have done differently</b></h9><br />
								<h7>Due to time constraints, I was only able to conduct five user interviews for my research and usability testing. During the usability testing, I found that single users would feel strongly about certain things. If I had interviewed more participants, I could have better identified whether such feelings were an outlier, or more common against users. 
								<br /><br /></h7>

<h9><b>Next Steps</b></h9><br />
<ul>
	<h7><li>Conduct another usability test to confirm whether users pain points users were effectively resolved. </li>
	<li>Handoff to development team!</li>
	</ul></h7></br></br>
