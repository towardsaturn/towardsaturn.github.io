							<TR>
							   <TD width=800>	<h7><b>Research Goals and Questions</b></h7><br />
								<h7>
									My research goal was to learn the motivations, likes and dislikes, and pain points of users who shop online, in order to create a responsive and successful website (Users can successfully put a desired item in their cart and check out). 
<br/><br/>

Some of the questions I had were: <br />
1. What drives users to shop online versus offline?  <br />
2. What helps them decide which online shop to purchase from? (Out of all the competitors)  <br />
3. What features help them decide what to buy. <br />
4. What excites them about online shopping? <br />
5. What are some challenges they face with online shopping? <br /><br />

<h7><b>Market Research</b></h7><br />

To begin with, I looked at direct and indirect competitors to gather data on features they incorporated and current e-commerce trends. I compiled all my research into a competitive analysis so that I could compare the strengths and weaknesses across the competitors. This helped me outline which features I could potentially include in my product design. 
<br/><br/>

<div style="text-align:center">

	<img src="mirror/Market research.png" width=80%><br/><br/>
	<img src="mirror/Research Ramp-Up.png" width=80%><br/>
</div><br/></br/>

<h7><b>User Interviews</b></h7><br />

Next, I completed user interviews with five interviews participants who fit the user demographics (shops online at least bi-monthly). Three were female and two were male. They were all between the ages of 24 to 29. Three Japan, and two were in Canada through remote interviews. For each of the interviews, I conducted a usability test with one of the competitors (H&M, Uniqlo, SHEIN, etc) with the participants to pan deeper into their likes and dislikes around online shopping.

<TABLE class="tabout">
	<TR>
	   <TD width=800>	<h7><b>Empathy Map</b></h7><br />
		
		
		<h7>After hearing what the participants had to say, I transcribed all thoughts and compiled them into an empathy map, organized into thinking/feeling, seeing, hearing, pains, gains and what they do.
<br/><br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="mirror/Empathy Map.jpeg" width=80%><br/><br/>
	   </div>

By consolidating my research, I was able to identify <span class="underline">four key patterns. </span><br/><br/>

	1. People are drawn to the idea of good deals and novelty/difficult to find products In other words, they need information on how they can best spend their money (coupons via newsletters, etc), and access to a variety of items that are in demand or rare in-store. There should also be  comparing features, search bar, filters, and plenty of customer reviews, giving users control when searching for the best deal or desired product.<br/><br/>


2. People like convenience; the idea of a quick, low-effort activity The online shopping experience should be be seamless- IA that users can make sense of, transactions that can be conducted in a low total number of clicks, have a variety of payment options, and guest checkout to make for a faster process<br/><br/>


3.  People enjoy the human aspect of online shopping. Attentive customer care such as neat packaging, personalized notes/gifts, were all joys expressed by interviewees. They claimed that it conveyed that the business “cared and respected their customers”. The idea of supporting small businesses run by individual people was also a delight expressed by interviewees, as well as customer reviews written by ordinary humans.<br/><br/>

4. Expectations not matching Reality A major pain for online shoppers are inconsistent images which waste their time, efforts, and prevent them from shopping somewhere. If the product is cheap, they may be disillusioned into accepting their loss and engaging in feelings of disappointment.<br/><br/>

<h7><b>User Persona</b></h7><br />
Based on the research and findings I had discovered, I then created a persona to represent MIRROR’s target audience and help guide my design. <br/><br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="mirror/joline.png" width=60%><br/><br/>
		   </div><br/><br/>

		   <h7><b>Project Goals, Features Map and Site Map</b></h7><br />
		   Next, I started to work on the information architecture of the project. I brainstormed project goals and compiled a road features map to further help me define necessary content. I also made a site map with the goal was to understand how pages were related to each other, and to organize content in a way that would make sense to users. 
		   <br /><br />
		   <div style="text-align:center">

			<img src="mirror/Site Map.jpg" width=60%> 
		</div><br/> 

		 <h7><b>Card Sort</b></h7><br />		   
		 In order to tap into how users organize items, I conducted an open card sort. Users organized clothing items into categories created by themselves. 
<br/><br/>
<div style="text-align:center">

						 <TABLE class="tabout">
							<TR>
							   <TD width=800>	<h7><b>Task and User Flows</b></h7><br />
								To understand how users may interact with the website, I thought about what tasks Joline, my persona, would do based on her goals, as well as the pages that she would encounter in that flow. 
<br/><br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="mirror/task flow.png" width=70%><br/><br/>
		   </div>

		   Fleshing it out even further, I thought about what decision points would occur within Joline while carrying out the task. These flows are essential to understanding how users may interact with a website, leading to a more optimal user experience.

				   <h7><b>Low-fi Wireframes </b></h7><br />

				   With my research under my belt, I was ready to start Wireframing! I sketched some low-fi wireframes that reflected my research findings, and referred to competitors for design patterns as well. After listening to feedback from my mentor and peers, I then drafted responsive wireframes in Figma for web, mobile and tablet platforms. 
<br/><br/>

		   </div>
		   <h7><b>Branding - Concept</b></h7><br />
		   Before I could move onto prototyping, I needed to develop brand identity and concept to guide my IU choices.

		   I gathered images and color palettes that were <span class="underline">#Clean #Fresh #Simple and #Modern</span><br/><br/>

		   <div style="text-align:center">
			<img src="mirror/Mood Board.png" width=70%><br/><br/>
				   </div> 
		   
				   <h7><b>Branding - Logo</b></h7><br />
				   Keeping in mind my mood board, I began to brainstorm Logos. I sketched up several, and ultimately chose one based on feedback from my mentor and peers.
<br/><br/>
				   <div style="text-align:center">

						   </div>

						   <h7><b>Branding - IU Kit</b></h7><br />
						   In order to maintain consistency, I created an IU kit. This proved to be very useful as I found myself referring to it as I moved towards the prototyping stage in my process. 
						   Thinking about the developers, I made sure that the different states of elements such as buttons and form fields were clearly designed. While designing the IU, I kept in mind the following design principles:<br/><br/>

						   1. <span class="underline">Consistency</span> Promotes learnability within users, and reduces confusion. <br/>
						   2. <span class="underline">Engaging</span> Allow users to engage with the product. Sections such as reviews and social media sections allow for user engagment.<br/>
						   3. <span class="underline">Focus </span> By eliminating disractions, the user can successfully complete their task.<br/>
						   4.<span class="underline">Minimalistic</span> I sought to remove unecessary elements, and to break tasks into smaller steps.  <br/>

					<h7><b>Usability Test</b></h7><br />

					Now, it was time to test the prototype I made and discover what worked, and what didn’t. <br/></br>

					<span class="underline">Objectives:</span>   <br/><br/>
1. Observe how easily and efficiently users are able to perform certain tasks (such as completing checkout or locating products) and understand their thought processes while doing so. <br/> 
2. Identify what kind, where, when, why and how user frustrations occur. <br/> 
3. Observe how many errors occur and assess whether they are recoverable? <br/> 
4. Learn user’s overall impressions on the design and branding<br/><br/>
<span class="underline">Methodology </span> <br/>
In-person interviews and remote interviews done via Zoom screen share.<br/><br/>

<span class="underline">Participants </span> </b><br/><br/>
- 5 participants in their 20’s <br/>
- Three female, two male<br/> 
- Has substantial experience with online shopping (shops online at least once every bi-monthly)<br/><br/>

Users were asked to complete the following <span class="underline">tasks:</span><br/><br/>


1. It’s getting cold and you’re in need of a new winter jacket. Your friend has recommended MIRROR to you. Please find yourself a jacket that you like. Feel free to use filters, user reviews, size charts, etc. Add the jacket to your cart and checkout as a guest.<br/><br/>

2. Your friend Joline has asked for your help in finding a specific item. She is looking for a formal blouse in Size S that is blue, and called “Lantern Sleeve Blouse”.<br/><br/>

It’s important to note that for men, the first task was change to “find a jacket for a female friend”. <br/><br/>

<h7><b>Affinity Map</b></h7><br />
After transcribing my interviews, I created an Affinity Map to help organize my findings and identify key takeaways 
<br/><br/>



<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="mirror/AffinityMap.jpg" width=70%><br/><br/>
		   </div> 

		   <h7><b>Key Findings</b></h7><br />

		 1. Completion Rate 100%<br/>
2. Participants overall don’t use the shop by style category to initially find items, and prefer it as a filter but still enjoy having the option.<br/>
3. Two users expressed wanting to have additional criteria filters such as filter by style, or sale.<br/>
4. The checkout process needs more transparency, such as including an order review summary <br/>
5. Users do not care for, nor notice the top of page and live chat buttons<br/>
6. Users really like a variety of payment methods<br/>
7. The size chart was not always easy to find and content/metrics were unclear.<br/>
8. Overall the process was familiar, and participants commented on the site appearing clean, and easy to navigate, but also mentioned the design being a bit “plain”.<br/><br/>

<h7><b>Priority Chart </b></h7><br />


To help guide my next steps, I created a priority revisions chart, organizing tasks into high-level, medium-level and low-level. This proved to be a very useful reference as I dove into iterations. <br/><br/>
<div style="text-align:center" vertical-align:top>
	<img src="mirror/Mirror revision notes.jpg" width=40%><br/><br/>
		   </div> 

		   <h7><b>Revisions</b></h7><br />
		   After learning the pain points of users, I began revising the details that didn’t meet user expectations.

							   <TD width=800>	<h7><b>What I learned</b></h7><br />
								1. E-commerce Trends: Through the research and implementation of this project, I familiarized myself with design patterns which I previously lacked knowledge on. <br/>
								2. Time prioritization strategies: The time constraints on the projects, and prioritization methods such as creating a road features map, and priority revisions helped me stay on track and focus on MVPs, instead of getting hung up on low priority features. <br/>
								3. This was a project that allowed me to push my research skills further. I was able to conduct a usability test which proved to be extremely insightful at uncovering users' delights and pain points. <br/><br/>
								<h7><b>What I would have done differently</b></h7><br />
								Due to time constraints, I was only able to conduct five user interviews for my research and usability testing. During the usability testing, I found that single users would feel strongly about certain things. If I had interviewed more participants, I could have better identified whether such feelings were an outlier, or more common against users. 
								<br /><br />

								<h7><b>Next Steps</b></h7><br />

								-Conduct another usability test to confirm whether users pain points users were effectively resolved. <br/>
- Handoff to development team!<br/>
