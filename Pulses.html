										Working with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), and The International Year of Pulses, I designed promotional banners and posters to be used at events, and on AAFC social media outlets.

								<h7>The challenge was to design visuals that were eye-catching and audience-engaging, while following AAFC's branding guidlines; clean, simple and quite conservative. I was provided with copy written material that had been prepared in advance by the department, and was tasked with incorporating the text into my designs in a visually pleasing way.
									‍</h7><br /><br />

							<b>Process</b><br />
							<h7>I met with the Communications Officer to research and outline the department’s wants and needs, which included a design that was professional and clean, accompanied with French versions of the designs.  I was also given a roughly two week deadline, so being able to prioritize and juggle projects was key.</h7>
							<br /><br />
							<h7>The next stage was brain mapping. In order to gain inspiration and help me determine my color palette, I googled various images of pulses.</h7>
							<br /><br />
							<h7>As I started drafting the prototype, I learned how challenging it can be working with pre-prepared text. I had to ensure that all the text given to me fit within the design, and was placed in the an appealing way. Some of the blocks of text were wordier than others, so I had to be mindful of white space. Another key challenge that I had to overcome was working with conservative branding guidelines. Throughout the design process, I had to keep in mind who the target audience was: typically middle aged adults.</h7>
							<br /><br />
							<h7>After finishing the prototype, I presented it to the Communications officer who suggested that Icreate a vertical version of the same design for variability and use.

								<h7>
									At various outreach events, members of the public were able to find our booth thanks to the eye-catching graphic, increasing overall audience engagement. It also helped give potential clients and passerbyers something to talk about. Those who were unaware about what AAFC is, or what the department does, struck up conveservation regarding the topic of pulses.
									‍<br /><br />
									In addition, the graphics were so well received by the department who originally intended to only use them for local events. As a result, I was able to collaborate with the graphics team in Ottawa who published my designs on AAFC's official Social media accounts.
